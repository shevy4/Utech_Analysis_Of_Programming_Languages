This repository contains the project requirements and guidelines for the Analysis of Programming Languages course (CIT4004) at the University of Technology, Jamaica.

## Project Description
The project entails designing and implementing a programming language that interfaces with a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard. The language should be deployed on a cloud platform like Microsoft’s Azure and demonstrate at least five characteristics of a good programming language as studied in class. Key components of the project include:

- Developing a compiler or interpreter for the new programming language.
- Incorporating a natural language interface for input.
- Performing lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis.
- Allowing cloud deployment for internet access.
- Specifying the language grammar in regular CFG, BNF, EBNF, or PEG formats.
- Utilizing development tools like LEX/YACC, FLEX/BISON, JLEX/CUP, Jack, PLY, or similar.
- Leveraging LLM for natural language processing.
- Deploying the language on Microsoft Azure or similar platform.

## Requirements
To successfully complete the project, students must:

- Produce a comprehensive project report.
- Develop an executable for lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis.
- Provide a natural language interface.
- Generate executable target code.
- Enable cloud deployment.
- Upload all project components to the course portal.
- Deliver a 7-minute presentation to the class.

## Minimum Syntax and Semantics
- Allow assignment of values to identifiers.
- Support arithmetic expressions.
- Implement conditional branching and execution.
- Display identifier values.
- Interpret identifier declarations, assignments, expressions, branching, type checking, and scope rules appropriately.

## Additional Features
- Define clear syntax and grammar.
- Support basic control structures.
- Implement scope and binding.
- Integrate with chosen LLM.
- Create a user-friendly interface.
- Host on Microsoft Azure or similar.
- Implement error handling.
- Provide thorough documentation.
- Include examples and tutorials.

## Bonus Marks
Additional features for bonus marks include providing a secure execution environment, extending the language with functions, complex data structures, libraries, etc.
